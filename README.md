## Introduction

This repository contains three distinct Java programs developed as part of the Open University's advanced Java language course. Each program is organized into separate packages within the project.

## Packages

### Word Guessing Game

The Word Guessing Game is an interactive Java application that challenges users to guess a word. The game provides hints and feedback to guide players toward the correct answer.

### Geography Examiner

The Geography Examiner is implemented using JavaFX and serves as an educational tool for testing and enhancing geographical knowledge. Users can answer questions related to geography, and the program provides feedback on their performance.

### Calculator

The Calculator program, also implemented in JavaFX, offers basic mathematical operations in a user-friendly interface. It provides a simple yet effective tool for performing calculations.
